_Hi I am Garima. In the previous period, I was a student of Quantitative skills and that's where I heard about the course_
_This course, according to my understanding will help me explore data more freely and will enhance my knowledge on wrangling with data in a more professional and precise manner. As this is an advanced level course, I truly believe it will further help me with my masters thesis too especially while working out my methodology_

_My favorite chapter from the RHDS book are chapter 3, 4 and 5 as they are once that truly helped me with my basics. I truly enjoy using the mutate function and also visualizing different plots_
